For the first problem, the script "drawgraph.py" takes data from "br.sm2", which must be in the same folder, and outputs the ROOT graphs in 3 data formats. The input file name was chosen as such, since it is the default output of HDECAY. To use, just run HDECAY and place "br.sm2" in the same folder as drawgrapg and run drawgraph.py. Additionally, since the decay width at 125 GeV was demanded explicitly, the python script prints it out on screen as well.
For the second problem, since FeynHiggs can be used externally with c++ or FeynHiggs, one would expect the output data to be in neat format. The graphing script "drawgraph2.py" takes in data from "data.dat" and the earlier used "br.sm2". "data.dat" is expected to have lines onyl in the form of "x y", where x is the higgs mass and y is the decay width. We expect both datasets to have the same amount of data and the datapoints to have approximately the same x values (mass of Higgs). Both data files are expected to be in this folder.

Since it was explicitly stated (in the email) that we shoudl only include our scripts and not include any event generators stuff, then I have only included the graphing scripts.
